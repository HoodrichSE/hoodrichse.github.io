								<p>Well, hey there.</p>
								<p>I’m a robotics engineer. I worked at Google for 5 years in an AI research team, working to create the breakthrough foundational model that will let AI understand something about the physics of our world. With such a model, AI would be able to operate on physical objects through machine actuators. Robots, in other words, and in the very Hollywood sense of the word.</p>
								<p>A few years into my time at Google, I started looking closer at the motivations that brought me there. I eventually realized I had been pursuing success for the wrong reasons. Achievement motivated my career, my social life, my love life, my hobbies, how I felt in the quiet times. It’s given me a great work ethic. I pushed myself to learn as much as I could as fast as I could.</p>
								<p>It also came with costs. I pushed myself into a constant state of sleep deprivation for years. I viewed risk and failure as threats to everything I’d worked for, instead as the most effective way to learn. I didn’t advocate for the things that were important to me. I let relationships weaken which could have been giving me direction and purpose. I generally felt awful about myself. And I’m sick of all that. I want to do better.</p>
								<p>You see, I’d been chasing achievement for the wrong reasons. I spent the first three decades of my life driven by perfectionism. I felt an immortal urge to prove myself in all things and at all moments. I hoped that one day, I could become enlightened, achieve Truth and Perfection, and finally be Enough. I put my faith in the perfect structures of logic to deliver this rapture unto me. I had witnessed the perfect harmony of logic while studying mathematics. Math showed me how the world could be radically changed through the disciplined procedure of stepping through logic to reach a neat conclusion. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be. But I had missed the point.</p>
								<p>Simply finding the right answer is… wrong, somehow? It sounds illogical to say it that way, but it’s true. Logic explores the consequences of an assumption. Given an axiom (which, like the fruit of the forbidden tree, we are forced to accept as divine truth because of its immaculate creation), deduce what will follow. It’s a wonderfully simple and powerful idea. But the real power of logic is not in making airtight deductions, it’s in choosing the axioms. Being right isn’t wrong because the answers you arrive at are illogical, it’s wrong because your assumptions are incorrect. Usually, even the act of framing the question logically is incorrect. </p>
								<p>The internet is the most amazing technology that humanity has ever seen. We have at our fingertips a wealth of knowledge nearly approximate to the sum of human thought. Even more incredible, it’s accessible to anybody who can connect to the network. We don’t even need to speak the same language any more. Not even the creation of writing had the same potential to spread knowledge. Historically, only the elite were able to benefit from education. Our modern world was built on the foundation of knowledge which those lucky few have built. What could the world look like if we enabled common people to become educated and share their ideas with the world?</p>
								<p>It’s nonsensical to approach most problems with a “right/wrong” way of thinking. Heisenberg showed that our world is uncertain at the most fundamental level. Lorenz showed that as soon as systems achieve a surprisingly low level of complexity, they become erratic and provably unpredictable. Gödel showed that logic itself is both incomplete and inconsistent.</p>
								<p>Life isn’t a domain of perfection. It doesn’t produce perfection, nor does it demand it. It may not even truly permit it. The universe is analog, not digital. It exists in a state of perpetual flow. Logic is a human construction; it’s a model, which we can map on to certain aspects of the world to understand it in a certain useful light. It’s not a path to purity or perfection. Those are human constructions, too.</p>
								<p>As these ideas started to break down my belief structures, I learned that I have so much more to gain and to offer by approaching life with an attitude of adventure and curiosity. </p>
								<p>And so now I blog, I guess. </p>
								<p>Anyway... Enough of the past, enough of me. What’s the purpose of this blog?</p>
								<p>I’ve been sitting on a dream for over a decade, hoping one day I’d find the courage to pursue it. It’s time. It’s an egalitarian dream: a world where tech empowers common people to live up to their inherent potential. </p>
								<p>I want to build tools for equality, peace, stability, and the betterment of humanity. I am concerned I may also have to advocate against the forces in this world which will want to concentrate and control this power, thereby causing abuse, whether intentionally or no (for more on that, see this wonderful summary by the people at 80000 Hours).</p>
								<p>I'm writing to explore ideas openly and connect with others on similar journeys. Whether this reaches nobody or many people, I want to foster the growth and learning that comes from putting ideas into the world and promoting the honest exchange of thoughts. I’ll do my darndest to expose my ignorance as I go, so I can invite more opportunities to learn, even though I’ll find the whole process uncomfortable.</p>
								<p>If you’ve found yourself here, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Please challenge my thinking, provide everybody with new insights, or share resources that have impacted you.</p>
